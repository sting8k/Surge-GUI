# Agent Operating Guide

This repository is in Harness v0 and contains an early-stage Surge Desktop app.

The current job of agents is to preserve and grow the collaboration harness while
maturing the app deliberately. Do not scaffold unrelated source folders,
platform shells, package scripts, CI, or tests unless a selected story explicitly
needs them.

## Source Of Truth

Read in this order:

1. `README.md` for project status.
2. `docs/HARNESS.md` for the human-agent operating model.
3. `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md` before turning any prompt into work.
4. The user-provided spec or prompt, when one exists.
5. `docs/product/` for current product contracts.
6. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before proposing implementation shape.
7. `docs/stories/` for story packets and backlog.
8. `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` for proof status.
9. `docs/decisions/` for why important choices were made.

This harness does not use a project-specific `SPEC.md` as the living plan. Treat
human direction as input material for product docs, story packets, architecture
decisions, and validation expectations. Product docs, stories, tests, and
decisions then become the living contract that agents should update as the system
evolves.

## Task Loop

For every task:

1. Classify the request with `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md`.
2. Identify whether the input is a new spec, spec slice, change request, new
   initiative, maintenance request, or harness improvement.
3. Locate the affected product docs and story files.
4. Check `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` for existing proof and gaps.
5. Work only inside the selected lane: tiny, normal, or high-risk.
6. Before finishing, ask:
   - Did product truth change?
   - Did validation expectations change?
   - Did architecture rules change?
   - Did we discover a repeated failure pattern?
   - Did the next agent need a clearer instruction?
7. Update routine harness files directly, or add a proposal to
   `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md` when the change is structural.

## Harness Change Policy

Agents may update directly:

- Story status and evidence.
- `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` rows.
- Links from story packets to product docs.
- Validation notes and reports.
- Small clarifications tied to the current task.

Agents should ask for human confirmation before:

- Changing architecture direction.
- Removing validation requirements.
- Changing the source-of-truth hierarchy.
- Changing risk classification rules.
- Replacing the feature workflow.

## Done Definition

A task is done only when:

- The requested change is completed or the blocker is documented.
- Relevant docs, stories, and test matrix entries remain current.
- Validation commands were run when they exist.
- Missing harness capabilities were added to `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`.
- The final response says what changed and what was not attempted.
